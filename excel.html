    <h2>Transfer Market Excel Analysis</h2>

              <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; padding: 10px;">
    I started by working in the <strong>Countries</strong> sheet, where I used Excelâ€™s <strong>Text-to-Columns</strong> tool to split data based on commas. I selected the <em>Delimited</em> option and set the delimiter as a comma.
    <br><br>
    After splitting the values, I cleaned up the continent names by removing extra spaces. I first made a copy of the list, then used the <strong>Remove Duplicates</strong> feature to simplify it. To clean up the text further, I used Excelâ€™s <strong>Find and Replace</strong> to eliminate unwanted spaces at the start of each continent name.
    <br><br>
    Once that was done, I moved to the <strong>Database</strong> sheet. I applied filters to the table and started exploring the <strong>Season</strong> column for the 2022/2023 data.

           <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; padding: 10px;">
    To create this table, I used Excelâ€™s <strong>SUMIFS</strong> function to pull transfer data based on multiple criteria. I focused on transfers during the <strong>2021/2022</strong> and <strong>2022/2023</strong> seasons, and filtered results specifically for the <strong>Europe</strong> continent.
    <br><br>
    While working on the <em>â€˜Transfers outgoingâ€™</em> row, I made sure to:
    <br><br>
    Point the formula to the correct column for outgoing/Incoming transfers.
    </p>

  </a>
  <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; padding: 10px;">
    In this part of the project, I wanted to take things a step further by building a more detailed table. The goal was to break down the number of player transfers and their financial value â€” both <strong>incoming</strong> and <strong>outgoing</strong> â€” for each European country.
    <br><br>
    I began by heading to the <strong>Countries</strong> sheet, applying a filter to show only <strong>European countries</strong>, then copied that list into a new sheet I created called <em>European Transfers by Country</em>. That formed the base structure for the table.
    <br><br>
    I used the <strong>SUMIFS</strong> function again here to calculate totals based on two criteria: <em>continent = Europe</em> and <em>season</em>. When calculating the outgoing transfers, I made sure to:
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li >Point to the appropriate 'outgoing' columns in the database.</li>
      <li>Use a minus sign in the formula to reflect outgoing movement correctly.</li>
    </ul>
    One thing I paid close attention to was how I <strong>locked cell references</strong> when setting up the formulas â€” that helped me reuse the same formulas efficiently as I moved across the table.
    <br><br>
    After finalizing the numbers for the <strong>2021/2022 season</strong>, I simply duplicated the same formulas for the <strong>2022/2023 season</strong>, updating only the relevant season value.
  </p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 2px solid grey; margin: 0 20px;;padding: 20px" />

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: auto; text-align: left;">
  <a class="image fit" href="images/europe_top_5_countries.PNG" target="_blank">
    <img src="images/europe_top_5_countries.PNG" alt="Top 5 European Countries by Transfer Spending" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;" />
  </a>
  <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; padding: 10px;">
    To highlight the biggest spenders in European football, I used the <strong>RANK</strong> function to identify the top five countries based on their <em>incoming transfer value</em>. The function compares each country's value to the entire range, giving us a quick look at who spent the most. Unsurprisingly, <strong>England, Italy, France, Germany, and Spain</strong> came out on top.
    <br><br>
    With those five selected, I moved to a new sheet called <em>Visualization Top 5 Countries</em> to organize data for a chart. I created a table where I:
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>Used <strong>SUMIF</strong> to get the total number of incoming transfers per country.</li>
      <li>Calculated the <strong>average transfer fee</strong> by dividing the total incoming value by the number of transfers.</li>
    </ul>
    This made it clear that English clubs werenâ€™t just doing the most transfers â€” they were also spending <strong>over $2 million per transfer</strong> on average.
    <br><br>
    To visualize the comparison, I created a combo chart. Since transfer volume and average fees use different scales, I added a <strong>secondary axis</strong> to show both clearly. I then:
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>Plotted the transfer count as columns.</li>
      <li>Plotted the average transfer fee as a line.</li>
      <li>Changed the chart style, removed the border, added a transparent background, and adjusted the font for a cleaner look.</li>
    </ul>
     <a class="image fit" href="images/chart.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="images/chart.png" alt="Top 5 European Countries by Transfer Spending" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;" />
  </a>
    The final chart tells the full story at a glance â€” showing not just who spends the most, but also how much each transfer is really costing them.

  <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; padding: 10px;">
    This project gave me the chance to dive deep into Excel and use it as a real analytical tool â€” not just for simple calculations, but for building meaningful insights from raw data.
    <br><br>
    I started with raw transfer data and used tools like <strong>Text-to-Columns</strong>, <strong>Find and Replace</strong>, and <strong>filters</strong> to clean and prepare the dataset. Then, I applied functions like <strong>SUMIF</strong>, <strong>SUMIFS</strong>, and <strong>RANK</strong> to break down the data by seasons, continents, and countries.
    <br><br>
    I created multiple summary tables to analyze transfers in and out of Europe, as well as transfers by individual countries. Finally, I used Excelâ€™s charting tools to bring everything together into a clear and visually engaging comparison of the top 5 European spenders.
    <br><br>
    ðŸ“˜ <strong>What I learned:</strong>
    
      <p>- How to clean messy data and structure it for analysis.</p>
      <p>- How to use conditional formulas like SUMIFS to filter values based on multiple criteria.</p>
      <p>- How to organize and present data visually with combo charts and secondary axes.</p>
      <p>- How to analyze and compare trends across different seasons and dimensions.</p>
    
    Overall, this project helped me strengthen my Excel skills and better understand how to turn raw sports data into useful insights. I'm proud of how the final result turned out â€” clean, clear, and packed with valuable information.
